# Join Us (Recruiting)

KHUBER is recruiting team members to prepare for **RoboCup 2026**.  
Humanoid soccer requires **perception, locomotion, hardware, strategy, and operations** to work together.

## Open roles
### Perception (CV/DL)
- ball/goal/line/robot detection
- tracking + latency compensation
- ONNX/TensorRT optimization

### Walking & Control (Dynamics/RL)
- MuJoCo/Isaac environments
- reward shaping, residual learning
- sim-to-real, domain randomization

### Embedded (STM32/RT)
- motor bus, IMU, ADC, foot sensors
- real-time scheduling + logging
- safety/watchdog

### Mechanical
- CAD, lightweight & stiff structure
- modular maintainability

### Strategy / Integration
- FSM, roles, set-plays
- ROS2 integration + tooling

## What you get
- Hands-on humanoid robotics development
- End-to-end autonomy pipeline (sim → hardware)
- Competition-ready deliverables (portfolio)

## How to apply
1. Your name / department / availability
2. Your focus area (1–2 roles above)
3. (optional) GitHub/portfolio links
